Building Defect Detection
Introduction
The Building Defect Detection project aims to classify buildings based on the presence of cracks. It utilizes the VGG16 convolutional neural network model as a transfer learning technique to achieve accurate and interpretable results. By detecting building defects, this project contributes to improving safety standards, preventing future defects, and providing recommendations for remedial actions.

The Python code for our model is deployed using Flask to the web interface. Here user interacts through the web interface, where you can upload an image and you can get whether there are building defects or not. please refer to the video through the link provided in the "Demo video with the link" section.

Key Features
Classification of buildings into two categories: cracked and not cracked
Transfer learning using the VGG16 model for accurate and interpretable results
Scalability and robustness for handling diverse building images
Performance analysis with metrics such as accuracy.
Interpretability analysis to understand the model's decision-making process
